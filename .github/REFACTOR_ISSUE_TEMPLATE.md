Review the codebase and make improvements:

- Fix failing tests (superlinter, ci, ui tests)
- Refactor duplicate code
- Address security vulnerabilities
- Improve code maintainability and performance
- Enhance UI accessibility
- Increase test coverage

**Rules:**
- Assign tasks to all available specialized agents in the repository (e.g., UI/UX Specialist, Test Runner, Code Review, etc.)
- Make minimal surgical changes, run all linters/tests before completing.
- **If work is too extensive to complete in one session:**
  - Create GitHub issues with the `refactor` label for remaining work
  - Each issue should have clear description, acceptance criteria, and code examples
  - Focus on completing critical fixes first, defer medium-priority items to issues
